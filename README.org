** Hey there! I'm Miguel 🚀

🧑‍💻 I'm currently working as an intern in Igalia as part of their Coding Experience program.

🎓 I studied Software Engineering at Universidade da Coruña, and I'm currently working on finishing my Bachelor's Thesis

🗺️ I feel at home in international contexts and I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, and comfortable communicating in Portuguese.

💻 I'm a long time Linux user and enthusiast. You can check my current dotfiles in this repo [[https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles][repo]], and some other older configurations can also be find in my github.

🛠️ Emacs is currently my editor of choice, but I've got some Vim-like bindings going on. If that piques your interest, find it [[https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/emacs-conf][here]]

📝 You can also check out my [[https://migueldeoleiros.github.io][blog]] where I post my thoughts on some other topics
